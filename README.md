# Workshop MLFPM closing conference

## Part 2 - Genomics, in R

To run on rstudio cloud for example (https://rstudio.cloud)

On public human GWAS data:

1. Explore/Describe data
2. Quality controls (e.g. maf, hwe, call rate, LD pruning...)
3. PCA (optional)
4. GWAS
5. GWAIS (epistasis)
6. Multiple testing correction
7. Network representation of GWAS and GWAIS
8. Network analysis (e.g. degree, largest connected component)
9. Pathway analysis (optional)

To do:
- Find public GWAS data or simulate
- Replace 1_PLINK with the corresponding R code as it may be complex to make the students downlowd and use PLINK
- Make sure 1_PLINK and 2_R correspond (data format, parameters...)
