# Workshop MLFPM closing conference

## Part 2 - Genomics, in R

**Goal**: Create a genomic example for the students with the standard steps of a GWAS analysis.

To run on rstudio cloud for example (https://rstudio.cloud)

On public human GWAS data:

1. Explore/Describe data
2. Quality controls (e.g. maf, hwe, call rate, LD pruning...)
3. PCA (optional)
4. GWAS
5. GWAIS (epistasis)
6. Multiple testing correction
7. Network representation of GWAS and GWAIS
8. Network analysis (e.g. degree, largest connected component)
9. Pathway analysis (optional)

To do:
- Find public GWAS data or simulate
- Step 2 to 5 in R 

Comments:
- step 1 to 5 correspond to the file 1_PLINK.txt (Goal: Replace 1_PLINK with the corresponding R code as it may be complex to make the students downlowd and use PLINK)
- step 6 to 9 correspond to the file 2_R.txt
